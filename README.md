Legitimate bug bounty programs value ethical practices and provide clear rewards to researchers for identifying security flaws, ensuring timely payments and responsible use of disclosed vulnerabilities.

Signs of a Trustworthy Bug Bounty Program:

`Clear Terms and Conditions`: Programs that explicitly define which vulnerabilities qualify for rewards and the exact reward amounts.

`Transparent Payment Structure`: Detailed information on payment timelines, payout methods, and consistent reports of researchers receiving their rewards.
